-----------------------------------

* Overview
----------
To achieve business goals, you need to boost performance and growth in critical areas. Identifying these areas requires instituting the most suitable performance measurement systems.

In this course, youâ€™ll learn how managing performance can be aided by identifying a performance problem using performance measurement systems. You'll also learn how to work with a key 
performance indicator (KPI).

Implementing a performance measurement system can be beneficial to a company'soutcomes and help it achieve its goals. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** IMPLEMENT A PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM.

Selecting the right key performance indicators can drive and direct a company's development, Fine-tuning results to boost performance and growth in critical areas.

In this course, you'll learn about the advantages of key performance measurement. What makes for good key performance indicators? And considerations and steps for selecting KPIs.

You'll also learn methods for defining the criteria for performance measures.

* Gaining an Advantage through Performance Measurement
------------------------------------------------------
What you measure gets attention. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** DEFINE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO MEASURE, FOR EXAMPLE THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF TASKS.

If sales volume is measuredand increases in sales are rewarded, the number of sales made typically goes up.

By the same token, you can't manage what you don't measure. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** IF WE DON'T MEASURE THE DEVELOPMENT SPEED WE CAN'T MANAGE IT.

If sales volume declines you need to know why.

Performance measurement helps an organization by providing quantifiable measurements that can be assessed and tracked over time and that relate directly to what drives the organization's 
success.

By measuring performance and setting targets,organizations can better achieve growth, improve their efficiency, and identify and troubleshoot problem areas in their performance.

**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** WE NEED TO SET TARGETS, FOR EXAMPLE DEFINING STORY POINTS FOR CODING AND DESIGN TASKS DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TASK, FOR EXAMPLE 5 POINTS FOR A STYLING 
A COMPONENT TASK AND DEFINE THE NUMBER OF STORY POINTS FOR A TWO WEEKS SPRINT. FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN 15 AND 18 STORY POINTS PER SPRINT.

Performance measurement tools can be applied on a small scale to a specific department or project or across the enterprise, and they can measure both financial and non-financial 
performance.

Performance measurement offers important advantages for organizations that apply it.

* First, it enables you to examine triggers for changes in performance. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** 
	. FOR EXAMPLE THE TEAM STARTED TO PERFORM BETTER AFTER THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BUSINESS ANALYST (DMITRY), THE BACK-END DEVELOPER (VITALIY), AND THE MAIN STAKEHOLDER OF THE 
	COMPANY (VALERIY MIKHAILOVICH) IMPROVED.

	. THE TEAM PERFORMS BETTER WHEN THE COMMUNICATION IS BETTER.

	. THE TEAM DOESN'T PERFORM WELL DUE TO THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE TECHNOLOGIES OF SOME MEMBERS OF THE TEAM.

When measures show a dip or spike for example, this alerts you to look for the causes.

You can then take action to influence whatever is driving the change to either sustain the positive results or make any needed corrections.

* Second, performance measurement puts you in a better position to manage performance proactively.

It makes it possible to set clear targets, put resources in place to achieve them, and track and reward accomplishments.

* Third, having performance measures allows for easy communication of top level strategic visions Instead of vague or intangible objectives,you can set clear goals stated in terms of and
measured by using quantifiable values.

* A fourth advantage is that performance measurement helps build a link between day-to-day operations and strategy.

It makes it clear how individual and departmental performance fits within the performance of the organization as a whole.

Before choosing performance measures for your part of the business, think about the link between those measures and organizational strategy.

Measures should align with company strategies,giving direction about what managers and employees should focus on.

Overall performance should then be regularly monitored to understand why it is or isn't reaching desired levels.

If a sales department is heavily rewarded only for high sales volumes forexample, this could have negative effects in other areas.

For instance, sales people might be tempted to make promises that are hard or expensive for other departments or they may focus exclusively on easy to move products or services to the 
exclusion of higher margin, but difficult to sell options.

Performance measures must also align with organizational structure.

To drive success, the measurement process must help determine the division of resources and assignment of responsibilities.

Highly centralized organizations have many interconnected departments or functional areas that rely on each other for mutual success.

Decentralized organizations consist of units that work more independently, often with managers who are largely autonomous.

Performance measures should be tailored to take this into account, so those measure complement the unit structure and apply to areas that a manager can control.

Proper performance measurement is key to effective business performance. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** REMEMBER THAT WE ARE SELLING A PRODUCT, THIS IS A BUSINESS, AND WE NEED TO MAKE EVERY DAY
AS MUCH PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE.

It allows organizations to test the real impact of current practices and changes and use the results to support informed management decisions.

* Understanding Key Performance Indicators
------------------------------------------
A key performance indicator, or KPI, is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving its key business objectives.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** ARE WE HELPING THE COMAPNY TO ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES?

KPIs form the basis of an organization's performance measurement system. They're one of the most powerful tools for driving growth and spotting both problem areas and potential  
opportunities for improvement.

Organizations use KPIs at multiple levels to evaluate their success in reaching strategic targets in any functional area, sales, manufacturing, marketing, and so on.

Organizations tailor their measurement systems by selecting KPIs relevant to their industries and to the functional areas being measured.

In a manufacturing company, for example, KPIs associated with production might include:

. overall equipment effectiveness,
. floor space utilization, 
. product quality, and 
. adherence to delivery schedules.

The KPIs relevant to the finance function of the company, of course, would be very different,including 

. profitability measurements, like gross profit margin,
. operating margin, ROI, and 
. return on capital employed.

In a customer call center, examples of KPIs might include

. the scores received on a customer satisfaction survey administered after a call,
. the time it takes to fulfill an order or the percentage of incoming calls answered within 30 seconds.

**** GAZPROMO PROJECT ****

. Adherence to delivery schedules (FOR THAT REASON WE CAN'T OVERLOOK THE TIME ALLOCATED FOR EACH SPRINT)
. Software quality
. Software effectivity
. Time for creating the Spike

KPIs are not just vanity metrics. Vanity metrics are data that scratch the surface of your brand performance, but don't show the full picture.

They are metrics like generalized site traffic, social followers, likes, and clicks.

For most organizations, these aren't true KPIs.

Though these numbers might be of use to, say, digital retailers,they don't get to the heart of what drives the economic engine of the organization, such as ROI, customer retention, or 
likelihood of future purchases.

KPIs are not simple metrics, either.

Simple metrics do have some value, because they show what your customers are doing but they don't offer insight into why they're doing it, or what they're likely to do next.

An example of a simple metric is a net promoter score or NPS, which is a score that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company's products or services to others.

These metrics are often simply numbers within a KPI.

They can help track performance and progress, but have limited standalone meaning without the context provided by the larger KPI's goals and objectives.

A KPI is only as valuable as the action it inspires.

To be useful, a KPI must masquerade as a form of communication.

It must communicate, succinct, clear and relevant information which is likely to be understood and acted upon.

Choosing pertinent, robust KPIs requires an organization to fully understand its objectives, how it plans to achieve them, and who can act on this information.

Getting to this point is a process that should incorporate feedback fromvindividuals in key roles across the organization,vas well as from managers and leaders.

A meaningful set of KPIs encapsulates what's truly important about you company's performance, and should be linked to the economic engine of the organization and to its business model.

Once an organization has robust KPIs in place, it will then be better equipped to monitor and make improvements to what really matters to organizational growth and success.

* Choosing a Performance Measure
--------------------------------
. What do you want to know about your company or function? 

. Are you interested in the ROI of a new sales initiative?

. How efficient your production methods are?

. What factors impact your delivery schedules? **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (WE NEED TO CLEARLY DEFINE THIS IN THE NEXT MEETING, WE NEED TO GET FEEDBACK FROM ALL MEMBERS OF THE TEAM).


To get the most out of performance measurement, you need to consider certain factors to choose the right key performance indicators, or KPIs.

1) First, useful measures will focus on critical activities or key success factors. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (DEFINE CLEARLY WHAT ARE THE CRITICAL ACTIVITIES AND THE KEY SUCESS FACTORS).

The key tasks or functions critical to achieving the organization's objectives and business goals.

These are the essential processes, activities, and functions that an organization must do well to implement its strategy successfully and sustain competitive advantage.

Incorrectly identifying the key success factors can result in managers ignoring or neglecting them in favor of non-essential or less important aspects of the business.

Once key success factors have been established, the measures used to evaluate performance can be built around them.

2) A second consideration is to promote goal congruence. That means considering the best interests of the organization as a whole. Achieving an improvement in one key measure shouldn't 
lead to the benefit of one department at the expense of others. **** GAZPROM PROJECT ****

It should benefit the organization overall.

3) Third, performance measures should focus on what managers can control or influence. Managers can't be held accountable for factors they can't control.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (FOR EXAMPLE AT THE MOMENT I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE OTHER PROJECTS THE COMPANY IS CREATING FOR OTHER CLIENTS, BUT THE OTHER PROJECTS ARE AFFECTING
THE GAZPROM PROJECT AND THIS INFLUENCE IS OUT OF MY CONTROL).


The performance measures designated for any functional unit should be chosen only for the factors their performance directly influences.

It doesn't make sense for shipping managers to track KPIs associated with marketing. Doing so won't impact their ability to affect company performance or success.

Sales and marketing managers, however, can influence performance in these areas. And they should be the ones to use those associated KPIs.

4) Ease of understanding is a fourth important consideration when selecting performance measures. Managers must know how decisions they make will effect the measurement of their unit's 
performance.

They can't make informed decisions based upon performance measures they don't understand.

A good performance measure should be easy to explain. And if a measure is quantitative, it should be straightforward to calculate.

But if the measure doesn't offer a clear guide on how the manager can improve performance, it serves little purpose.

5) As a fifth consideration, when appropriate to the need, there should always be a balance focus on both the short and long run KPIs.
*** GAZPROM PROJECT **** THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN STRUGLIN' BETWEEN THE NEED TO DELIVER QUICKLY A FIRST DEMO, AND HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS DEMOS COULD AFFECT THE
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FINAL QUALITY PRODUCT THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE.

Future performance shouldn't be sacrificed for current performance and viceversa.

Achieving this balance is an ongoing challenge faced by all organizations.

Many other considerations may also come into play when selecting appropriate performance measures.

. Feasibility, 
. fairness, 
. and the potential for unintended consequences should all be taken into consideration.

For instance, is there the possibility that employees will take shortcuts in order to meet targets? **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS, BECASUE THE URGENCY FOR
DELIVERING THE FIRST DEMO CAN MAKE US OVERLOOK VARIABLES, FACTORS, OR IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE CALCULATIONS THAT WILL MAKE US LOSE TIME IN THE FUTURE ****

By taking all these factors into consideration, managers will be able to choose the appropriate KPIs. And achieve optimal performance for their business.
